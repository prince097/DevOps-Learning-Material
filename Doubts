******** Doubt ********

1) In Devops material from Praveen class - In jenkins Interview question from Session 3, some questions are not have clear explanation or explained with Apache server examples. How to deal with those? Or shall we proceed with General jenkins interview questions from Abhishek?

Ans- praveen also has jenkins interview questions and answers. go through that will be enough.
